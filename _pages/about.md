I'm a post-bacc reseacher working with Dr. Elizabeth Losin at Penn State Univesity. 
I have a degree in cognitive science, and have spent the last 2.5 years since my graduation studying health disparities and group differences in pain perception. I have experience collecting behavioral and fMRI data, analyzing data using cutting edge methods in computational neuroscience and affective computing.
